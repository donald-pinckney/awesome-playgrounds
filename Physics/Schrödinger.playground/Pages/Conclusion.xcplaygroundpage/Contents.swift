# Conclusion

Schrödinger's Equation is central to explaining the motion and bound states of quantum particles.  However, like some other differential equations, solutions to it can be difficult, cumbersome, or even impossible to obtain analytically.  In these situations, numerical computation methods are a crucial tool. Hopefully through this lab you have briefly seen how differential equations can be solved using computers, and could apply a similar algorithm to other problems. In addition, by solving Schrödinger's Equation for 3 different potential functions, perhaps some intuition and understanding of Schrödinger's Equation was gained.
