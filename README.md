# awesome-playgrounds
A collection of awesome Xcode Swift playgrounds, centered around interactive and instructive use in topics such as computer science, math, and physics.

Hopefully these playgrounds can be motivating for what playgrounds can accomplish.

## Necessary Developer Tools
As of now all playgrounds take advantage of the newly released multiple pages feature, and thus require use Xcode 7 beta software.
